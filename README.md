# My dot files
This repo is to organize my configuration files so that I can use them across devices and easily reinstall my system with they.

I sync these configurations using [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)

## NeoVim
I am using the [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) configuration as the base.

## Sway
Sway Window Manager

## Fish
Fish shell

## General system scripts
Some other stuff I use
